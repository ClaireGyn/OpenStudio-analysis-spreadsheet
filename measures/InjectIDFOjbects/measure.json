  "modeler_description_xml": "This provides a stepping stone between exporting an IDF from OpenStudio and hand editing the IDF and writing fully functional OpenStudio EnergyPlus measures.\n\nThis measure works for when you just need to add new IDF objects. If you need to interact with or alter IDF objects made by the OpenStudio forward translator, you will want to write an EnergyPlus measure wtih more use-case specific logic.",
